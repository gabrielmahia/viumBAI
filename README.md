# Artificial Vision and Language Processing for Robotics
Learning the basics of robots and important issues while working with them, compare different methods used to work with robots and explore computer vision, its algorithms, and limits; learning how to control the robot with natural language processing (NLP) commands, study Word2Vec and GloVe embedding techniques, non-numeric data, recurrent neural network (RNNs), and their advanced models.
